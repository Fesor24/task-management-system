Database setup

With Docker:
1. Ensure docker is installed on your system
2. Navigate to root directory of project, where a 'docker-compose.yml' file is
3. Open a command prompt in the directory, type 'docker-compose up -d'
4. If the process was successful, you should have your database set up
5. Open the project, at the bottom left, you should see a Package Manager Console, if you don't see, at the top bar, click on Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console
6. When the console opens, type 'update-database'
7. Now your database has been set up with the relevant tables. When you run the project, the necessary tables for hangfire will be created

 If you want to view the database, you can go to http://localhost:8080, we would be using adminer for this
 Enter the following credentials: 
 - System: PostgreSQL
 - Server: db
 - Username: postgres
 - Password: taskmgtpw,
 - Database: task_mgt

Without Docker (you have postgres installed):
1. Open the project
2. Navigate to appsettings.development.json
3. Where you see default connection, change the Server from 'localhost:4422' to 'localhost:5432'
4. Change the password to your postgres password
Follow step 5 to 7 above.
